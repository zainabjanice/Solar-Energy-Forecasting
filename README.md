## Project Story
The rise of renewable energy has reshaped the way we think about electricity generation, with solar power taking center stage. As more solar panels are installed across cities and rural areas, the sheer volume of data they generate offers a unique opportunity: to **turn raw environmental measurements into actionable insights**.  

SolarVision was born from the vision of combining **cutting-edge AI** with **immersive 3D visualizations**, transforming complex solar data into an interactive experience. By blending deep learning predictions with intuitive dashboards and stunning Blender-rendered visuals, the project aims to **empower energy planners, engineers, and enthusiasts** to explore solar trends, anticipate fluctuations, and make informed decisions.  

This is more than just a forecasting tool—it's a bridge between data, technology, and actionable energy solutions.

## The Problem
Unreliable solar energy forecasting can lead to:
- Grid instability  
- Inefficient energy storage  
- Financial losses for solar farms  

SolarVision addresses this by predicting solar output with high accuracy while offering an interactive 3D visualization to understand solar patterns intuitively.

## How the system works
### 1. Dataset :

 Solar Power Generation Data. This data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over 34 days. It has two pairs of files - each pair has one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset. The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The sensor data is gathered at a plant level, with a single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.

**Features:** 

 - *AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE*:  is the temperature of the surrounding environment where a person, object, or process exists. 
 - *MODULE_TEMPERATURE*: There's a module (solar panel) attached to the sensor panel. This is the temperature reading for that module.
 - *IRRADIATION*: Amount of irradiation for the 15-minute interval.
 - *DC_POWER*: Amount of DC power generated by the inverter (source_key) in this 15 minute interval. Units - kW.

**Target:**
 -  *AC_POWER*: Amount of AC power generated by the inverter (source_key) in this 15 minute interval. Units - kW.
   
**Preprocessing:**

After checking the missing values in the four datasets **Plant_1_Generation_Data**, **Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data**,  **Plant_2_Generation_Data**, **Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data** , merging  **Plant_1_Generation_Data** with **Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data** and merging  **Plant_2_Generation_Data**, **Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data** , merge the two merged data 1 and 2 by columns date and Plant_ID, we have the total merged data, after this step we created the model data which holds the features columns; the set of feature and the target variable.

   *AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE*, we have a bell-shaped, but skewed to the right (long tail toward higher temps). Most common values are between 22°C and 28°C. Mean ~ 26.7°C: close to the center, but             skewed      by hotter days. Ambient temperature is mostly moderate, with occasional hotter values. Good spread, no extreme outliers.

   *MODULE_TEMPERATURE*, we have a skewed right (long tail). Most common values are between 20°C and 30°C, but some modules reach up to 60°C. Mean ~ 31.9°C, pulled upward by high values. Module temperature is        often higher than ambient (as expected in solar panels). Important to check how this correlates with power output.

   *IRRADIATION*, we have a very skewed: huge spike at 0, then spread between 0.1 and 1.0. Mean ~ 0.23, much lower than the max (1.2). Many records were taken at night or on very cloudy days (irradiance = 0).        This feature explains why power can often be near zero.

   *DC_POWER*, we have a huge spike at 0, with some spread to higher power (mean ~1708). Suggests that many time points had no generation (night/clouds). Needs filtering: zero power at night should not bias           modeling.

   *AC_POWER*, similar to DC power: spike at 0, then spread with mean ~275. Lower mean than DC (conversion losses). Pattern follows DC power as expected. Also affected by night values.
